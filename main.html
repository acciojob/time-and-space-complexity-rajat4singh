	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on. Time complexity is efficient measure in algorithm analysis.</p>
	<p>The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called <b>space complexity</b> of the algorithm.  If we need to create an array of size n, this will require O(n) space.</p><br>
